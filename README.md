# Z180 Assembly syntax highlighting

It is a syntax highlighting package for the Z180 assembler that was created from scratch because the other two available packages did not convince me.

This highlighting was born after I tried to modify another syntax highlighting package and ended in disaster due to the original code having some bugs.

This package highlights from the basics in a way that is compatible with several semi-universal syntaxes on the Z80 and Z180 assemblers.

The macro syntax was made in such a way that it should not give compatibility problems with most assemblers.

Any macro that is not highlighted is because the syntax seeks compatibility with the Z80asm of the Z88DK. Still, an attempt was made to cover most cases in a general and portable way for use with any Z80/Z180 compatible assembler, but especially with the Z180.
